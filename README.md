**Stamp* is library for automating the email template workflow using Jade and Gulp in unison.

##Features

**Gulp** as a task runner

_gulp-jade:_ html template engine<br>
_gulp-postcss:_ css post processor<br>
_gulp-inline-css:_ inlines styles from an external stylesheet<br>
_gulp-inline-source:_ embeds styles from an external stylesheet<br>
_gulp-html2txt:_ converts compiled html templates into txt versions

**Jade** as an HTML compiler

Jade was chosen for Stamp because it provides a level of inheritance perfect for sharing markup and characteristics between several templates.

**Postcss** as a CSS post processor

Postcss was chosen for Stamp because it can serve as a simple, yet flexible, tool that can evolve with the needs of each individual template.

##Hierarchical Structure

Stamp is structured to provide multiple levels of shared characteristics while still allowing for the author to individualize each email template.

###Global Level

* Solves various issues prevalent in email clients.
* Sets up the ability for full column table rows on small screens.
* Provides a system for showing and hiding content.
* Contains the head section of every email template.

###Template Level

* Provides a template for all pages pertaining to that template.
* Contains styles that are more focused on design rather than solving email client quirks.
* Can override the title element from the global level.

###Pages Level

* Can override any blocks on the template level.
* Houses content for each individual page.
* Can override the title element from the template level.
